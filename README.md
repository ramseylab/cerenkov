## Computational Elucidation of the REgulatory NonKOding Variome

CERENKOV is a software pipeline and associated machine-learning classifier for
identifying regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms (rSNPs) in the noncoding
genome for post-analysis of genetic regions identified in genome-wide
association studies (GWAS).  CERENKOV was created by Yao Yao, Zheng Liu,
Satpreet Singh, Qi Wei, and Stephen Ramsey at Oregon State University.  We have
submitted research article describing the CERENKOV computational approach and
demonstrating CERENKOV's accuracy for discriminating rSNPs from nonfunctional
SNPs to the 2017 ACM-BCB conference, and prior to publication of the article we
will publish the complete source code for CERENKOV on this GitHub project page.
