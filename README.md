## Computational Elucidation of the REgulatory NonKOding Variome

CERENKOV is a software pipeline and associated machine-learning classifier for
identifying regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms (rSNPs) in the noncoding
genome for post-analysis of genetic regions identified in genome-wide
association studies (GWAS).  CERENKOV was created by Yao Yao, Zheng Liu,
Satpreet Singh, Qi Wei, and Stephen Ramsey at Oregon State University.  We have
submitted a research article describing the CERENKOV computational approach and
demonstrating CERENKOV's accuracy for discriminating rSNPs from nonfunctional
SNPs to the 2017 ACM-BCB conference.

The March 2017 data files for CERENKOV can be accessed on the [Ramsey Lab file server](http://files.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/Ramsey_Lab/cerenkov/datafiles_201703)
(see README.md files under the subdirectories of the GitHub CERENKOV project area,
for more information about which data files are used in which parts of CERENKOV).
