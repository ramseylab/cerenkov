## Computational Elucidation of the REgulatory NonKOding Variome

CERENKOV is a software pipeline and associated machine-learning classifier for
identifying regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms (rSNPs) in the noncoding
genome for post-analysis of genetic regions identified in genome-wide
association studies (GWAS).  CERENKOV was written by Zheng Liu, Yao Yao,
Satpreet Singh, Qi Wei, and Stephen Ramsey at Oregon State University.  We have
submitted research article describing the CERENKOV computational approach and
demonstrating CERENKOV's accuracy for discriminating rSNPs from nonfunctional
SNPs to the 2017
[Research in Computational Molecular Biology (RECOMB)](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cb/recomb2017/)
conference, and prior to publication of the article we will publish the complete
source code for CERENKOV on this GitHub project page.
